//! \brief Describes EPANET's Project class.

//! \mainpage EPANET
//! EPANET performs extended period hydraulic and water quality analysis of
//! looped, pressurized piping networks. A network consists of pipes, pumps,
//! valves, junctions, storage tanks and reservoirs. EPANET tracks
//! the flow of water in each pipe, the pressure at each junction, the height
//! of water in each tank, and the concentration of a chemical species
//! throughout the network during a simulation period comprised of multiple
//! time steps. In addition to chemical species, water age and source tracing
//! can also be simulated.

    //! and the engines and methods used to carry out the analysis. All
    //! methods applied to a project and its components can be done in a
    //! thread-safe manner.
